    "This project addresses the task of **semantic segmentation of unexpected objects on roads**, more generally known in the literature as *open-set semantic segmentation*, *open-world semantic segmentation*, or *anomaly segmentation*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional semantic segmentation methods fail to detect objects that were not seen during training (e.g., a cat on the road misclassified as asphalt). This limitation poses significant challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a model capable of segmenting 12 known classes from the StreetHazards dataset (`building`, `fence`, `other`, `pedestrian`, `pole`, `road line`, `road`, `sidewalk`, `vegetation`, `car`, `wall`, `traffic sign`) while also identifying anomalous objects that appear only in the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will guide through the setup, data loading, model definition, evaluation, and qualitative analysis of the results. We use PyTorch Lightning for structuring the code and Weights & Biases for experiment tracking."
